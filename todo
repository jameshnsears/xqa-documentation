xqa-ingest readme 
= uml link needs fixing
= fix other uml

migrate junit-docker-http aross releavnt java project
= except for xqa-query-balancer

get xqa-query-ui and then xqa-query-balancer working then
make sure they are built OK and running in BUILD-PREREQUISITES.md
+
improve coverage in xqa-query-*

graphs for xquery request / respones

re-run all the graphs - as some of the msi ones are wrong.

go through and tune xqa-perf paramaters + tidy up the readme

enable log level from "command" param?

do a travis for xqa-documeentation
= build the containers from src (on cron) and push into docker hub

sort out github tags so uniform

sort out XQA-QUERY-UI

https://medium.com/criciumadev/its-time-migrating-to-java-11-5eb3868354f9

problem is that xqa-ingest-balancer must be started after other processes started?

fix retired.xqa-shard-JMS

run on  k8s

--

change secondaryTimeout value to 3s = tune the graphs!!
= but also have a retry, in case we get:

eventually rm fron any repo the dependency on having a running xqa-message-broker?
= as makes testing in circleci slower / more painful

= xqa-query-ui
= do I need to do all of :sudo apt install git openjdk-11-jre python3-dev python3-pip python3-distutils maven nodejs npm ????

in build script I get lots of "mkdir cannot create dir '/tmp/xqa': File exists'"

make sure no contianer_name_1 _1's around!
