get an azure pipeline to work, that builds all my apps each night

    - for xqa
    - junit-docker-http
    - pytest-docker-py

work on xqa-query-ui

make sure everything builds in new VM via instructions BUILD-PREREQUISITES.md

prune issues in xqa-documentation

+
go through and tune xqa-perf paramaters + tidy up the readme on how to do this

run on k8s

fix retired.xqa-shard-JMS

have it so that there is a build script in each xqa-project and that xqa-perf
