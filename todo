work on junit-docker-http
= sort out packagas in test folder
= get it working standlone
= then migrate across releavnt java projects

create a radiator .md that shows all badges on one page

go through and tune xqa-perf paramaters + tidy up the readme

xqa-ingest readme = uml link needs fixing

enable log level from "command" param?

check my coverity results!

do a travis for xqa-documeentation
= build the containers from src (on cron) and push into docker hub

sort out github tags so uniform

sort out XQA-QUERY-UI

move java projects away from requiring docker-compose

https://medium.com/criciumadev/its-time-migrating-to-java-11-5eb3868354f9

problem is that xqa-ingest-balancer must be started after other processes started?

fix brexit soundboard

fix retired.xqa-shard-JMS

--

change secondaryTimeout value to 3s = tune the graphs!!
= but also have a retry, in case we get:

eventually rm fron any repo the dependency on having a running xqa-message-broker?
= as makes testing in circleci slower / more painful

make sure BUILD-PREREQUISTES works in VM
= xqa-query-ui
= do I need to do all of :sudo apt install git openjdk-11-jre python3-dev python3-pip python3-distutils maven nodejs npm ????
= test it 100% from start to finish

in build script I get lots of "mkdir cannot create dir '/tmp/xqa': File exists'"

update circle ci files with correct software

in xqa-perf change # of cores 
- from logical to physical
= say running notively Ubuntu 18.04 with SSD

make sure no contianer_name_1 _1's around!
